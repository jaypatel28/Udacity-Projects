Portfolio apps developed during the iOS Nanodegree Program.

► Pitch Perfect
• The Pitch Perfect app allows users to record a sound using the device’s microphone. It then allows users to play the recorded sound back with four different sound modulations: Chipmunk, Darth Vader, Super Slow, and Super Fast.
• The app has two view controller scenes.
• Record Sounds View: Allows users to record a sound.  
• Play Sounds View: Allows users to play the recorded sound back with effects.

► MemeMe
• MemeMe is a meme-generating app that enables a user to attach a caption to a picture from their phone. After adding text to an image chosen from the Photo Album or Camera, the user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. MemeMe also temporarily stores sent memes which users can browse in a table view and a collection view.

► On The Map
• The On The Map app allows users to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs, allowing students to place themselves “on the map,” so to speak. 
• First, the user logs in to the app using their Udacity username and password. After login, the app downloads locations and links previously posted by other students. These links can point to any URL that a student chooses. Students are encouraged to share something about their work or interests.
• After viewing the information posted by other students, a user can post their own location and link.

► Virtual Tourist
• This app allows users specify travel locations around the world, and create virtual photo albums for each location. The locations and photo albums will be stored in Core Data.
• The app will have two view controller scenes.
• Travel Locations Map View: Allows the user to drop pins around the world. Tapping and holding the map drops a new pin. Users can place any number of pins on the map. When a pin is tapped, the app will navigate to the Photo Album view associated with the pin.
• Photo Album View: Allows the users to download and edit an album for a location. If the user taps a pin that does not yet have a photo album, the app will download Flickr images associated with the latitude and longitude of the pin. All changes to the photo album will be automatically made persistent.
